# Atomic
Software for multi-level annotation of linguistic corpora

## Build

`mvn install` creates three different versions of Atomic:

1. Stable (in *repository/target/products/*): Includes only stable features.
2. Review (in *repository-review/target/products/*): Includes features that can be used productively with caution, and that may include bugs.
3. Experimental (in *repository-experimental/target/products/*): Includes features that are experimental, and hence should not be used productively.
