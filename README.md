> ***Atomic*** (see also the [*Atomic* homepage](http://linktype.iaa.uni-jena.de/atomic/)) is an open source annotation software for multi-level deep linguistic annotation of text corpora. It is based on the *Eclipse RCP*, a modular rich client platform. It features a graphical editor which can be controlled via keyboard, mouse, and command shell (with the native annotation language *AtomicAL*). It works on a concrete implementation of the generic graph-based meta-model *Salt*, and embeds its complementary conversion framework *Pepper*, allowing for n : m mapping between data formats (cf. the [SaltNPepper homepage]((https://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/p/projects/saltnpepper/wiki/)).
