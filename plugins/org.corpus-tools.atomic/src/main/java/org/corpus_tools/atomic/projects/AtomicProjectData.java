/**
 * Atomic project data is basically a String-based graph representing
 * the Atomic project structure, i.e.:
 * <p>
 * A project, which contains exactly one {@link SaltProject} (not
 * represented as {@link SaltProject}s are always XMI-persisted in
 * a file called SaltProject.salt).
 * <p>
 * Zero or more root corpora, depending on how the user wants to
 * organize her or his project:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the project will contain only one corpus, there will be
 * one single corpus (which will be contained in one single
 * {@link SCorpusGraph}, not represented here).</li>
 * <li>If the project will contain more than one corpus, the
 * structure depends on how the user will organize the project:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If all corpora are to be contained on one level, one default
 * root corpus will be created to contain all corpora. This root
 * corpus, in turn, will be contained in in one single
 * {@link SCorpusGraph}, not represented here.</li>
 * <li>If the corpora will be organized under different
 * root corpora, these root corpora will be created to
 * contain their respective sub corpora. Each of these
 * root corpora will be contained in a seperate
 * {@link SCorpusGraph} to ensure structural compatibility
 * with ANNIS.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Each non-root corpus can contain m documents, 
 * which contain exactly one source text each.
 * <p>
 * The relation between project and corpora is one of association
 * rather than structural containment.
 * <p> 
 * Classes implementing this interface provide the necessary methods
 * to construct an object containing all data that a multi-corpus,
 * multi-document project in Atomic can hold.
 * <p>
 * See also the graphical in {@link ProjectCreator}.
