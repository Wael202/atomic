 * A project node is a node in the n-ary corpus structure tree, i.e.,
 * an abstraction over corpora and documents. Every {@link ProjectNode}
 * must have a {@link String} name.
 * <p>
 * In Atomic, a project (the topmost structural entity for data) can
 * contain one or more corpora, which in turn can contain zero or more
 * corpora ("sub-corpora") as well as zero or more documents (containing
 * the source text).
 * <p>
 * In other words, a project in Atomic can contain one or more
 * n-ary trees, the nodes of which are implementations of this
 * interface, i.e., a corpus or a document.
