 * <p>
 * A project, which contains exactly one {@link SaltProject} (not
 * represented as {@link SaltProject}s are always XMI-persisted in
 * a file called SaltProject.salt), which contains a corpus graph
 * (not represented as Atomic assumes that there is always only
 * exactly one corpus graph), which contains n corpora, which
 * contain m documents each, which contain exactly one source text
 * each.
 * <p>
 * The relation between project and corpora is one of association
 * rather than structural containment.
