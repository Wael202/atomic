abstract: |
	Atomic is an extensible annotation platform for multi-layer linguistic corpora. It runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
	The software works on the graph-based, generic **Salt** data model, and therefore can process diverse annotation types.
	It also includes **Pepper**, a conversion framework for linguistic data, which makes it compatible with a large number of linguistic formats.
	Atomic can be extended via plugins, i.e., new editors, views, analysis or processing components can be added to the platform.

	Atomic is open source under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

# Note

Atomic is currently undergoing a complete overhaul.

This does not make it feasible to publish any user documentation at this point. All released versions of Atomic will, however, include comprehensive user documentation in different formats.
