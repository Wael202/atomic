# Build Atomic

# Build the documentation {#build-documentation}

---
**NOTE**

> For a **release**, the documentation will have to be built **first**, otherwise the product will not contain the latest auto-generated Eclipse Help files!

---

## User documentation {#user-documentation}

To build the documentation, go to `{HOME}/docs/org.corpus_tools.atomic.doc/` and run 

    mvn clean package -P docs

The HTML documentation will be in `{HOME}/docs/org.corpus_tools.atomic.doc/target/docbkx/html/`.

The PDF documentation will be in `{HOME}/docs/org.corpus_tools.atomic.doc/src/main/resources/`.
It will also have been copied to `{HOME}/features/org.corpus_tools.atomic.feature/rootfiles/`.	

The Eclipse Help files generated by Doxygen will have been copied to `{HOME}/plugins/org.corpus_tools.atomic/doc/help/`.

## Developer documentation {#developer-documentation}

In order to build the developer documentation locally, you have to have **Doxygen** installed on your build system. [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org/) is a tool that generates documentation from source code.

To build the documentation, go to `{HOME}/docs/org.corpus_tools.atomic.doc/` and run 

    mvn clean package -P docs

The HTML documentation will be in `{HOME}/docs/org.corpus_tools.atomic.doc/target/doxygen/`.
